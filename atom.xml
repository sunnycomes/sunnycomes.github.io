    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Unix is 35. Some people consider that the official start of middle age, although for a computer technology it&rsquo;s more like existing since the Middle Ages. Over that time, Unix and its child Linux have collected a lot of history and some quite archaic language. In this tip, we&rsquo;ll have a look at a few of the more ancient bits of crusty stuff and identify their purposes, if not their actual origins.</p>

<h3>RC</h3>

<p>Perhaps the most common abbreviation in Linux is &ldquo;rc,&rdquo; short for &ldquo;runcomm&rdquo; &mdash; short in term for &ldquo;run command.&rdquo; Today, &ldquo;rc&rdquo; is a suffix added to any script-like file that is called during the startup stage of a program, or of Linux in general. Thus /etc/rc is the master script for Linux startup, and .bashrc is the script that runs when the bash shell starts. The &ldquo;.&rdquo; prefix on .bashrc is a naming standard designed only to hide user-specific administrative files from user files; the &ldquo;ls&rdquo; command doesn&rsquo;t list such files by default, and &ldquo;rm&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t delete them by default. Many programs demand that startup files or profile files begin with a period or have an &ldquo;rc&rdquo; suffix, but there&rsquo;s nothing magical about either from the file system&rsquo;s perspective.</p>

<h3>ETC</h3>

<p>The &ldquo;etc&rdquo; in &ldquo;/etc/bin&rdquo; really does stand for &ldquo;etcetera.&rdquo; In early Unix systems, the most important directory was the &ldquo;bin&rdquo; directory (short for &ldquo;binaries&rdquo; &mdash; compiled programs), and &ldquo;etc&rdquo; was for trivial stuff like startup, shutdown and admin. The list of things you need for running Linux is: a program binary, etcetera, etcetera &mdash; in other words, a sole vital item, plus some less important bits and pieces. Today, &ldquo;etc&rdquo; holds system-wide configuration files that you&rsquo;d almost never do without &mdash; hardly unimportant.</p>

<h3>Bin</h3>

<p>Most large subsystems that run on Linux today, like GNOME or Oracle, use their own &ldquo;bin&rdquo; directories (or /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin) as a standard place for compiled programs. It&rsquo;s common now to see scripts in those directories too, since &ldquo;bin&rdquo; directories are frequently added the PATH of a user, making their run-able programs available. So run-able scripts are often stuck in bin as well.</p>

<h3>TTY</h3>

<p>Perhaps the most confusing jargon in Linux relates to terminals. TTY is an old abbreviation for a TeleTYpe. Teletypes, or teletypewriters, were originally printer-keyboard combinations that read and sent information over a serial line, not too different from an ancient telegraph machine. Later on, when computers only ran in batch mode (when card readers were the only way to get your program loaded), a teletype was the only useful &ldquo;real time&rdquo; input/output device available. Eventually teletypes were replaced with keyboard-and-screen terminals, but the operating system still needed a program to watch the serial port where the terminal or TTY was plugged in. That&rsquo;s what a getty &ldquo;GEt TTY&rdquo; process is: a program watching a physical TTY/terminal port. A Pseudo-TTY (a fake TTY, a &ldquo;PTY&rdquo;) is the terminal equivalent of a virtual network computing (VNC) server. When you run an xterm or GNOME Terminal program, the PTY acts as a TTY for the virtual or pseudo terminal that the xterm represents. &ldquo;Pseudo,&rdquo; meaning &ldquo;duplicating in a fake way,&rdquo; is really a more descriptive term than &ldquo;virtual&rdquo; or &ldquo;emulated.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a shame that it has fallen out of fashion in computing.</p>

<h2><a name='links'></a>Links</h2>

<p>Most URLs will automatically be turned into links. To be explicit, just write it like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;http://someurl&gt;  
&lt;somebbob@example.com&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<!-- more -->


<blockquote><p><a href="http://someurl">http://someurl</a><br/>
<a href="&#x6d;&#97;&#x69;&#x6c;&#116;&#111;&#x3a;&#x73;&#x6f;&#x6d;&#x65;&#x62;&#98;&#111;&#x62;&#64;&#101;&#120;&#97;&#109;&#112;&#108;&#x65;&#46;&#x63;&#111;&#x6d;">&#x73;&#x6f;&#109;&#x65;&#98;&#98;&#111;&#98;&#x40;&#x65;&#x78;&#97;&#x6d;&#x70;&#x6c;&#x65;&#46;&#x63;&#x6f;&#x6d;</a></p></blockquote>

<p>To use text for the link, write it:</p>

<pre><code>[like this](http://someurl)
</code></pre>

<p>You can add a <em>title</em> (which shows up under the cursor):</p>

<pre><code>[like this](http://someurl "this title shows up when you hover")
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<blockquote><p><a href="http://someurl">like this</a></p>

<p>You can add a <em>title</em> (which shows up under the cursor):</p>

<p><a href="http://someurl" title="this title shows up when you hover">like that</a></p></blockquote>

<hr />

<h2><a name='reference_links'></a>Reference Links</h2>

<pre><code>You can also put the [link URL][1] below the current paragraph like [this][2].  
[1]: http://url  
[2]: http://another.url "A funky title"  
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<blockquote><p>You can also put the <a href="http://url">link URL</a> below the current paragraph <a href="http://another.url" title="A funky title">like</a> this.</p></blockquote>

<p>Here the text &ldquo;link URL&rdquo; gets linked to &ldquo;<a href="http://url">http://url</a>&rdquo;, and the lines showing &ldquo;<a href="http://url">1</a>: <a href="http://url">http://url</a>&rdquo; won&rsquo;t show anything.</p>

<pre><code>[shortcut]: http://goes/with/the/link/name/text
</code></pre>

<p>Or you can use a <a href="http://goes/with/the/link/name/text">shortcut</a> reference, which links the text &ldquo;shortcut&rdquo; to the link named &ldquo;<a href="http://goes/with/the/link/name/text">shortcut</a>&rdquo; on the next paragraph.</p>

<p>Output:</p>

<blockquote><p>Or you can use a <a href="http://goes/with/the/link/name/text">shortcut</a> reference, which links the text &ldquo;shortcut&rdquo; to the link named &ldquo;<a href="http://goes/with/the/link/name/text">shortcut</a>&rdquo; on the next paragraph.</p></blockquote>

<hr />

<h2><a name='artifact_links'></a>Artifact Links</h2>

<p>Any forge resource (artifact) can be linked with surrounding square brackets, e.g.</p>

<pre><code>[MyPage] 
or 
[#123]. 
</code></pre>

<p>These artifact links can take several forms.</p>

<hr />

<h2><a name='simple_links'></a>Simple Links</h2>

<p>Most commonly, the artifact identifier can simply be surrounded with square brackets. Here are some examples:</p>

<pre><code>[MyWikiPage]       # Wiki - name of wiki page  
[#123]             # Tracker - ticket number  
[r10721]           # SVN - revision number  
[3b9d48]           # Git &amp; Mercurial - first 6 characters of revision hash  
[2012/02/my-post]  # Blog - post slug, including YYYY/MM/ prefix  
[a6d38f98]         # Discussion Thread - thread id  
[a6d38f98#42f8]    # Discussion Post - thread_id#post_id  
</code></pre>

<h3>Two-part Links</h3>

<p>To link to an artifact in a specific tool, use the form: <code>[tool:artifact]</code>, where <code>tool</code> is the name of the tool as it appears in the URL. Two-part links are useful when you have two tools of the same type installed. For example, let&rsquo;s say you have a &lsquo;bugs&rsquo; tracker and a &lsquo;features&rsquo; tracker installed, and you want to link to the first ticket in each:</p>

<pre><code>[bugs:#1]  
[features:#1]
</code></pre>

<h3>Three-part Links</h3>

<p>To link to an artifact in another project, use the form: <code>[project:tool:artifact]</code>, where <code>project</code> is the name of the project as it appears in the URL. For example:</p>

<pre><code>[allura:wiki:Home]
</code></pre>

<p>To link to an artifact in a subproject, use the form: <code>[project/subproject:tool:artifact]</code>, where <code>subproject</code> is the name of the subproject as it appears in the URL. For example:</p>

<pre><code>[allura/sub:code:3b9d48]
</code></pre>

<hr />

<h2><a name='basic_text_formatting'></a>Basic Text Formatting</h2>

<p>Use * or _ to emphasize things:</p>

<pre><code>*this is in italic*  and _so is this_  
**this is in bold**  and __so is this__  
***this is bold and italic***  and ___so is this___
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>this is in italic</em>  and <em>so is this</em><br/>
<strong>this is in bold</strong>  and <strong>so is this</strong><br/>
<strong><em>this is bold and italic</em></strong>  and <strong><em>so is this</em></strong></p></blockquote>

<p>You can strike through text using HTML like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;s&gt;this is strike through text&lt;/s&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<blockquote><p><s>this is strike through text</s></p></blockquote>

<p>Two blank spaces at the end of the line do the same work as <br/> in <em>html</em>, making a line break. <em>(A little bit different from the origin post)</em>.<br/>
Two carriage returns make a new paragraph.</p>

<hr />

<h2><a name='blockquotes'></a>Blockquotes</h2>

<p>Use the > character in front of a line, just like in email</p>

<pre><code>&gt; Use it if you're quoting a person, a song or whatever.

&gt; You can use *italic* or lists inside them also.
And just like with other paragraphs,
all of these lines are still
part of the blockquote, even without the &gt; character in front.
</code></pre>

<p>To end the blockquote, just put a blank line before the following
paragraph.</p>

<p>Output:</p>

<blockquote><p>Use it if you&rsquo;re quoting a person, a song or whatever.</p>

<p>You can use italic or lists inside them also.
And just like with other paragraphs,
all of these lines are still
part of the blockquote, even without the > character in front.</p></blockquote>

<p>To end the blockquote, just put a blank line before the following paragraph.</p>

<hr />

<h2><a name='preformatted_text'></a>Preformatted Text</h2>

<p>If you want some text to show up exactly as you write it, without Markdown doing anything to it, just indent every line by at least 4 spaces (or 1 tab). As an alternative to indenting, you can use 4 or more tildes before and after the text. See examples in the Code Highlighting section(<em>xxxxx</em> at the head of line is a placeholder for one tab):</p>

<pre><code>This line won't *have any markdown* formatting applied.  
I can even write &lt;b&gt;HTML&lt;/b&gt; and it will show up as text.  
This is great for showing program source code, or HTML or even  
Markdown. &lt;b&gt;this won't show up as HTML&lt;/b&gt; but  
exactly &lt;i&gt;as you see it in this text file&lt;/i&gt;.  
</code></pre>

<p>Within a paragraph, you can use backquotes to do the same thing.<code>This won't be *italic* or **bold** at all.</code></p>

<p>Output:</p>

<blockquote><p>This line won&rsquo;t <em>have any markdown</em> formatting applied.<br/>
I can even write <b>HTML</b> and it will show up as text.<br/>
This is great for showing program source code, or HTML or even<br/>
Markdown. <b>this won&rsquo;t show up as HTML</b> but<br/>
exactly <i>as you see it in this text file</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p>Within a paragraph, you can use backquotes to do the same thing.<code>This won't be *italic* or **bold** at all.</code></p>

<h2><a name='lists'></a>Lists</h2>

<p>(Here is some place different from the origin counterpart, accutally not powerful as it described, and pay attention that the next line must be blank, even two blank spaces(break line) don&rsquo;t work.)</p>

<pre><code>* an asterisk starts an unordered list
* and this is another item in the list
+ or you can also use the + character
- or the - character
</code></pre>

<p>To start an ordered list, write this:</p>

<pre><code>1.this starts a list *with* numbers  
1. this will show as number "2."  
1. this will show as number "3."  
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<blockquote><ul>
<li>an asterisk starts an unordered list</li>
<li>and this is another item in the list</li>
<li>or you can also use the + character</li>
<li>or the &ndash; character</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>To start an ordered list, write this:</p>

<blockquote><ol>
<li>this starts a list <em>with</em> numbers</li>
<li>this will show as number &ldquo;2.&rdquo;</li>
<li>this will show as number &ldquo;3.&rdquo;</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<h3>Multi-level List###</h3>

<p>(Newly added, 2013.12.26 21:15)</p>

<pre><code>* First Level
 * Second Level, add one more space than first level
      * Third Level, add six more spaces than first level
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<blockquote><ul>
<li>First Level</li>
<li>Second Level, add one more space than first level

<ul>
<li> Third Level, add six more spaces than first level</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<h2><a name='tables'>Tables</h2>

<p>(We will talk about this feature later)</p>

<hr />

<h2><a name='more_headers'>More Headers</h2>

<p>More ways of doing headers:</p>

<pre><code># this is a huge header #  
## this is a smaller header ##  
### this is even smaller ###  
#### more small ####  
##### even smaller #####  
###### smallest still: `&lt;h6&gt;` header  
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<blockquote><h1>this is a huge header</h1>

<h2>this is a smaller header</h2>

<h3>this is even smaller</h3>

<h4>more small</h4>

<h5>even smaller</h5>

<h6>smallest still: <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code> header</h6></blockquote>

<p>You can use up to 6 # characters at the beginning of the line.</p>

<hr />

<h2><a name='horizontal_rule'></a>Horizontal Rule</h2>

<p>Just put three or more &ldquo;*&rdquo; or &ldquo;&ndash;&rdquo; on a line:</p>

<pre><code>----------------
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<blockquote><hr /></blockquote>

<p>Or, you can use single spaces between them, like this:</p>

<pre><code>* * *
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<hr />

<p>or</p>

<hr />

<p>Make sure you have a blank line above the dashes, though, or else:</p>

<h2>you will get a header</h2>

<hr />

<h2><a name='images'></a>Images</h2>

<p>To include an image, just put a &ldquo;!&rdquo; in front of a text link:</p>

<pre><code>![alternate text](https://sourceforge.net/images/icon_linux.gif)
</code></pre>

<p>You can also use a title if you want, like this:</p>

<pre><code>![tiny arrow](https://sourceforge.net/images/icon_linux.gif "tiny arrow")
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<blockquote><p><img src="https://sourceforge.net/images/icon_linux.gif" alt="alternate text" />
The &ldquo;alternate text&rdquo; will show up if the browser can&rsquo;t load the image.</p></blockquote>

<p>You can also use a title if you want, like this:</p>

<blockquote><p><img src="https://sourceforge.net/images/icon_linux.gif" title="tiny arrow" alt="tiny arrow" /></p></blockquote>

<p>Some other features like macro is not covered here since not support in my lib.</p>

<p>What if you want to just show asterisks, not italics?</p>

<pre><code>* this shows up in italics: *a happy day*  
* this shows the asterisks: *a happy day*
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<blockquote><ul>
<li>this shows up in italics: <em>a happy day</em></li>
<li>this shows the asterisks: <em>a happy day</em></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>What is you want to show the angle brackets <code>"&lt;xxx&gt;"</code>, not for special purposes? This example is newly added.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;b&gt;place `` on the left of the close bracket.&lt;/b&gt;  
&lt;b&gt;place back quotes between the brackets&lt;/b&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<blockquote><p><b>xxxx</b><br/>
<b>place back quotes between the brackets</b></p></blockquote>

<p>The backslashes will disappear and leave the asterisks. You can do the same with any of the characters that have a special meaning
for Markdown.</p>

<p>Many simple HTML tags are allowed, for example <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> And unknown tags will be dropped. To show a literal <b> or an unknown tag like <foobar> you need escape it with HTML entities: :</p>

<pre><code>&lt;b&gt;this will be bold&lt;/b&gt;  
you should escape &lt;unknown&gt; tags  
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<blockquote><p><b>this will be bold</b><br/>
you should escape <unknown> tags</p></blockquote>

<p>HTML tags that are block-level like <div> can be used, but if there is markdown formatting within it, you must add a &ldquo;markdown&rdquo; attribute: <code>&lt;div markdown&gt;</code> Some safe attributes are also allowed, permitting basic styling and layout: <div markdown style="float:left"></p>

<p>Individual ampersands (&amp;) and less-than signs (&lt;) are fine, they will be shown as expected.</p>

<hr />

<h2><a name='table_of_contents'></a>Table of Contents</h2>

<p>You can display a list of links to jump to headers in a document. Sub-headers will be nested.</p>

<p>[TOC]</p>

<pre><code># Section 1  
## Sub-section 1  
# Section 2  
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<blockquote><h1>Section 1</h1>

<h2>Sub-section 1</h2>

<h1>Section 2</h1></blockquote>

<hr />

<h2><a name='code_highlighting'></a>Code Highlighting</h2>

<p>The code highlighting syntax uses CodeHilite and is colored with Pygments. It follows the same syntax as regular Markdown code blocks, except that there are two ways to tell the highlighter what language to use for the code block.</p>

<p>If the first line of the codeblock contains a shebang, the language is derived from that and line numbers are used(actually not).</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/python  
# Code goes here ...
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<blockquote><h1>!/usr/bin/python</h1>

<h1>Code goes here &hellip;</h1></blockquote>

<p>If the first line contains a shebang, but the shebang line does not contain a path (a single / or even a space) or If the first line begins with three or more colons, the text following the colons identifies the language. In both cases, the first line is removed from the code block before processing.</p>

<pre><code>:::python  
# Code goes here ...
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<blockquote><p>:::python</p>

<h1>Code goes here &hellip;</h1></blockquote>

<h2>Introduction:</h2>

<p>Java Performance Tuning (abbreviated as JPT), 2nd edition provides a comprehensive guide to eliminate all the types of performance problems. By considering real-life examples JPT shows how to get rid off all the types of performances problems. For example JPT shows tricks such as how to minimize object creation and replacing strings with arrays can really pay off in improving code performance.</p>

<p>Few of important fundamentals and guidelines included in Java Performance Tuning are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Tuning tips for object creation.</li>
<li>Tuning in JDBC.</li>
<li>Web services performance tips.</li>
<li>Tuning in EJB.</li>
<li>Tuning in J2EE.</li>
<li>Tuning in JMS.</li>
<li>Tuning in RMI.</li>
</ul>


<p>Guidelines for tuning java code without destroying program&rsquo;s skeleton is efficiently presented in second edition of Java Performance Tuning. It includes how to use threads effectively, how to optimize the use of strings, minimizing the creation of objects in program, avoiding bottleneck operation by including all the important fundamentals of Software Engineering to re-pioneer the code, issues of speed of Servlets and JSPs etc. That provides very crucial guidelines in performance tuning for java developers.</p>

<h2>Tuning Tips for Object Creation:</h2>

<p>Object Creation is one of the most basic and essential thing while developing a Java Application, as such; object defines the physical reality of class. Pay proper attention while declaring class&#8217; methods and variables because careless work carried out at this stage, can cost you in terms of speed and performance because variables and methods unwontedly declared and initialize can create overhead in overall speed. Object should always be created early when there is spare time in the application, object once created should be in hold position until it is required. Care should be taken while defining methods that can accept the reusable objects to be filled with the data rather than methods that return objects holding that data, immutable objects can also be used here. Object should be created only when class logically needs. Constructor of class should always be simple. Methods that alter objects directly should always be preferred. Use classes that handle primitive data types rather than wrapping the primitive data types.</p>

<h2>Performance Tuning in JDBC:</h2>

<p>Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) is mainly used in most of the Java application. To keep trace on performance tuning in JDBC becomes very crucial and prime issue when Java developer realizes that most of the processing time should not be wasted behind data processing over the network. For more details, check out  <a href="http://www.iovi.com/blog/2013/10/31/basic-practical-usage-of-jdbc-api/">here</a></p>

<p>Here are few of the tuning tips for JDBC that can improve the over all performance in Java application.</p>

<ul>
<li>SQL statements should be tuned to minimize the data that is return from the database.</li>
<li>Use of prepared statements and parameterized SQL statements can speed up the over all process in data processing.</li>
<li>Transaction conflicts should always be avoided.</li>
<li>Usage of stored procedures, connection pooling, selection of fastest JDBC driver should be encouraged.</li>
<li>Any of the open resources that is not in use in Java application can keep processor engaged unwontedly, any of the resource that is open and not required to perform any of database activity should be closed like Connections, Statements, ResultSet etc.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Web Services performance tips:</h2>

<p>Because of Java&rsquo;s outstanding performance in web services there are few of the performance tips that are to be considered while developing a web service application. Here are few of the tips given for improving the web services performance.</p>

<ul>
<li>Avoid using XML messaging, this helps to achieve fine-grained RPC.</li>
<li>Frequency of the messaging should be taken into consideration with the replication of the data as necessary.</li>
<li>Always try to retrieve data during off-hours this helps in course gained transactions.</li>
<li>Overall system performance should never be neglected and optimized until we know where the bottlenecks are present.</li>
<li>Asynchronous messaging model should always be taken into account when transport is slow or / and unreliable, or when processing is complex and long running.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Tips for Quality of services for Web Services</h2>

<p>The main requirements in quality of service for web services are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Availability and accessibility.</li>
<li>Integrity and reliability. This ensures that weather program will crash or not while it is running, if so, how often can it crash.</li>
<li>Number of simultaneous request that can be made to application by the user i.e. &ldquo;throughput&rdquo; and what will be the response time to process this request by application i.e. &ldquo;latency&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Security issues.</li>
<li>HTTP is a best-effort delivery service as far as web services issue is concerned. The main reason behind this is that request could simply be dropped. Messaging in web services should always be Asynchronous because Asynchronous messaging can improve throughput no matter at the cost of latency.</li>
<li>DOM based parsers are slower than SAX based ones.</li>
<li>Requests results should be cached whenever it is possible.</li>
<li>Extreme care should be taken to make sure that resources are not locked for long periods of time to avoid serious scalability problems.</li>
</ul>


<p>Other factor that affects web service performance are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Response time of web server.</li>
<li>Availability of web server.</li>
<li>Execution time of web application.</li>
<li>Backend database.</li>
<li>Scaling web services Tips</li>
</ul>


<p>Use of faster communication protocol, like plain socket, should always be preferred. Whenever there is requirement of sending large number of documents over the network, basic load-balancing scheme should be achieved, all the documents to be sent should have different URL hosts i.e. binding addresses. For scalability of server better and speedy hardware should be preferred though there is limitation of scalability of server,  that most application performance does not scale linearly with increases in the hardware power. Most of the times in web related services cluster of more than one server is used.</p>

<h2>Performance Tuning tips for EJB:</h2>

<p>While developing an EJB application if EJB services for an object is not required than plain Java object should be replaced in place of EJB object. Multiple remote method calls should be changed into one remote method call with all the data combined into a parameter object to enhance the overall process. There should be proper tuning in EJB Server thread count; Use Stateless session beans pool size to minimize the creation and destruction of the beans. When multiple EJB remote calls have to be changed into one session bean remote call and several local calls(SessionFacade), wrap multiple entity beans in a session bean. Transactional time-out should be set previously. Use HttpSession object rather than Stateful session bean to maintain client state. Bulk updating should be used to reduce the overall database calls to fetch and retrieving the data. When dealing with large amounts of data such as searching large database JDBC should be directly used rather than using entity beans.</p>

<h2>J2EE Performance tuning tips:</h2>

<p>Here few of the important tuning tips for J2EE in points.</p>

<ul>
<li>Entity beans from session beans should always be accessed.</li>
<li>When you no longer need to use session call HttpSession.invalidate() to clean up a session.</li>
<li>Save resources by turning off automatic session creation using <code>&lt; % @page session="false" % &gt;</code> for web pages that don&rsquo;t require session tracking.</li>
<li>Use compile time directive <code>&lt; % @include file="copyleft.html" % &gt;</code> where possible.</li>
<li>Whenever beans are co-located in the same JVM, use local entity beans.</li>
<li>Proprietary stubs can be used for caching and batching data.</li>
<li>To generate unique primary keys dedicated remote object should be used.</li>
<li>Whenever possible use cache tagging.</li>
<li>User JDBC directly instead of using an entity bean only for data access.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Tuning tips for JMS:</h2>

<p>For developing an efficient JMS application transient variables should be used to reduce serialization overheads. For receiving messages asynchronously implement MessageListener. To avoid persistency overhead choose non-durable (NON_PERSISTENT) messages wherever appropriate. It is practically efficient to use <code>DUPS_OK_ACKNOWLEDGE AND AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE</code> than <code>CLIENT_ACKNOWLEDGE</code> as far as issue of performance is concerned. Separate transactional sessions and non-transactional sessions for transactional and non-transactional messages should be used separately. Because of the fact that &ldquo;a higher redelivery delay and lower redelivery limit reduces the overhead&rdquo; remember to tune the destination parameters. Open java resources can claim for more system resources never forget to close all the resources whenever they are not in use. The last point to be kept while developing a JMS application is that consumer should always start before we start the producer so that the initial messages do not need to be queued up.</p>

<h2>RMI tuning performance tips:</h2>

<p>To improve the performance in RMI application always consider altering the Tcp WindowSize parameter. To measure the bandwidth of network netp erf should be used. By setting the properties sun.rmi.dgc.client.gcInterval and sun.rmi.dgc.server.gcInterval RMI garbage collection should be configured in a proper manner. Since sending the object over network may consume much of the time in a big application sending groups of objects together rather than one object at a time is advisable. To speed up the transfers, implement Externalize interface. To handle special cases such as singleton or reusable objects use special codes. To improve overall development quality never try to add the extra complications once the performance target have been met.</p>

<li>On average, a web request performs 4 database queries.</li>
<li>Experience has shown that database calls are typical performance bottleneck.</li>
<li>Bad JDBC can overwhelm the database.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="steps"></a>Basic Steps to Write a JDBC Program</h2>

<p>The following are the basic steps to write a JDBC program</p>

<ol>
<li>Import java.sql and javax.sql packages</li>
<li>Load JDBC driver</li>
<li>Establish connection to the database using Connection interface</li>
<li>Create a Statement by passing SQL query</li>
<li>Execute the Statement</li>
<li>Retrieve results by using ResultSet interface</li>
<li>Close Statement and Connection</li>
</ol>


<p>We will look at these areas one by one, what type of driver you need to load, how to use Connection interface in the best manner, how to use different Statement interfaces, how to process results using ResultSet and finally how to optimize SQL queries to improve JDBC performance.</p>

<h3><a name="driver"></a>Choosing the right Driver</h3>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th align="center"><em>Type</em> </th>
<th align="center"> <em>Tier</em> </th>
<th align="center"> <em>Driver mechanism</em> </th>
<th align="center"> <em>Description</em></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="center">1 </td>
<td align="center">2  </td>
<td align="center">JDBC-ODBC    </td>
<td align="center">This driver converts JDBC calls to ODBC calls through JDBC-ODBC Bridge driver which in turn converts to database calls. Client requires ODBC libraries.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">2 </td>
<td align="center">2  </td>
<td align="center">Native API &ndash; Partly &ndash; Java driver</td>
<td align="center">This driver converts JDBC calls to database specific native calls. Client requires database specific libraries.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">3 </td>
<td align="center">3  </td>
<td align="center">JDBC &ndash; Net -All Java driver</td>
<td align="center">This driver passes calls to proxy server through network protocol which in turn converts to database calls and passes through database specific protocol. Client doesn&rsquo;t require any driver.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">4 </td>
<td align="center">2  </td>
<td align="center">Native protocol &ndash; All &ndash; Java driver</td>
<td align="center">This driver directly calls database. Client doesn&rsquo;t require any driver.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p>Type 3 &amp; 4 drivers are faster than other drivers because Type 3 gives facility for optimization techniques provided by application server such as connection pooling, caching, load balancing etc and Type 4 driver need not translate database calls to ODBC or native connectivity interface. Type 1 drivers are slow because they have to convert JDBC calls to ODBC through JDBC-ODBC Bridge driver initially and then ODBC Driver converts them into database specific calls. Type 2 drivers give average performance when compared to Type 3 &amp; 4 drivers because the database calls have to be converted into database specific calls. Type 2 drivers give better performance than Type 1 drivers.</p>

<h3><a name="connection"></a>Optimization with Connection</h3>

<p>We have different approaches to establish a connection with the database, the <strong>first</strong> type of approach is :</p>

<ol>
<li>DriverManager.getConnection(String url)</li>
<li>DriverManager.getConnection(String url, Properties props)</li>
<li>DriverManager.getConnection(String url, String user, String password)</li>
<li>Driver.connect(String url, Properties props)</li>
</ol>


<p>When you use this approach, you can pass database specific information to the database by passing properties using Properties object to improve performance. For example, when you use oracle database you can pass default number of rows that must be pre-fetched from the database server and the default batch value that triggers an execution request. Oracle has default value as 10 for both properties. By increasing the value of these properties, you can reduce the number of database calls which in turn improves performance. The following code snippet illustrates this approach.</p>

<pre><code>    java.util.Properties props = new java.util.Properties();
    props.put("user","scott");
    props.put("password","tiger");
    props.put("defaultRowPrefetch","30");
    props.put("defaultBatchValue","5");
    Connection con = DriverManger.getConnection("jdbc:oracle:thin:@hoststring", props);
</code></pre>

<p>You need to figure out appropriate values for above properties for better performance depending on application&rsquo;s requirement. Suppose, you want to set these properties for search facility, you can increase defaultRowPrefetch so that you can increase performance significantly.</p>

<p>The <strong>second</strong> type of approach is to get connection from DataSource. You can get the connection using javax.sql.DataSource interface. The advantage of getting connection from this approach is that the DataSource works with JNDI. The implementation of DataSource is done by vendor, for example you can find this feature in weblogic, websphere etc. The vendor simply creates DataSource implementation class and binds it to the JNDI tree. The following code shows how a vendor creates implementation class and binds it to JNDI tree.</p>

<pre><code>    DataSourceImpl dsi = new DataSourceImpl();
    dsi.setServerName("oracle8i");
    dsi.setDatabaseName("Demo");
    Context ctx = new InitialContext();
    ctx.bind("jdbc/demoDB", dsi);
</code></pre>

<p>This code registers the DataSourceImpl object to the JNDI tree, then the programmer can get the DataSource reference from JNDI tree without knowledge of the underlying technology.</p>

<pre><code>    Context ctx = new InitialContext();
    DataSource ds = (DataSource)ctx.lookup("jdbc/demoDB");
    Connection con = ds.getConnection();
</code></pre>

<p>By using this approach we can improve performance. Nearly all major vendor application servers like weblogic, webshpere implement the DataSource by taking connection from connection pool rather than a single connection every time. The application server creates connection pool by default. We will discuss the advantage of connection pool to improve performance in the next section.</p>

<h4>Use Connection Pool</h4>

<p>Creating a connection to the database server is expensive. It is even more expensive if the server is located on another machine. Connection pool contains a number of open database connections with minimum and maximum connections, that means the connection pool has open connections between minimum and maximum number that you specify. The pool expands and shrinks between minimum and maximum size depending on incremental capacity. You need to give minimum, maximum and incremental sizes as properties to the pool in order to maintain that functionality. You get the connection from the pool rather directly .For example, if you give properties like min, max and incremental sizes as 3, 10 and 1 then pool is created with size 3 initially and if it reaches it&rsquo;s capacity 3 and if a client requests a connection concurrently, it increments its capacity by 1 till it reaches 10 and later on it puts all its clients in a queue.</p>

<p>In general, transaction represents one unit of work or bunch of code in the program that executes in it&rsquo;s entirety or none at all. To be precise, it is all or no work. In JDBC, transaction is a set of one or more Statements that execute as a single unit.
java.sql.Connection interface provides some methods to control transaction they are</p>

<pre><code>    public interface Connection {
        boolean getAutoCommit();
        void        setAutoCommit(boolean autocommit);
        void        commit();
        void        rollback();
    }
</code></pre>

<h4>JDBC&rsquo;s default mechanism for transactions:</h4>

<p>By default in JDBC transaction starts and commits after each statement&rsquo;s  execution on a connection. That is the AutoCommit mode is true. Programmer need not write a commit() method explicitly after each statement.Obviously this default mechanism gives good facility for programmers if they want to execute a single statement. But it gives poor performance when multiple statements on a connection are to be executed because commit is issued after each statement by default, that in turn reduces performance by issuing unnecessary commits. The remedy is to flip it back to AutoCommit mode as false and issue commit() method after a set of statements execute, this is called as batch transaction. Use rollback() in catch block to rollback the transaction whenever an exception occurs in your program. The following code illustrates the batch transaction approach.This batch transaction gives good performance by reducing commit calls after each statement&rsquo;s execution.</p>

<h3>Choose optimal isolation level</h3>

<p>Isolation level represent how a database maintains data integrity against the problems like dirty reads, phantom reads and non-repeatable reads which can occur due to concurrent transactions. java.sql.Connection interface provides  methods and constants to avoid the above mentioned problems by setting different isolation levels.
public interface Connection {</p>

<pre><code>    public static final int  TRANSACTION_NONE                               = 0
    public static final int  TRANSACTION_READ_COMMITTED                 = 2
    public static final int  TRANSACTION_READ_UNCOMMITTED           = 1
    public static final int  TRANSACTION_REPEATABLE_READ            = 4
    public static final int  TRANSACTION_SERIALIZABLE                   = 8
    int          getTransactionIsolation();
    void        setTransactionIsolation(int isolationlevelconstant);
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>More details are covered in <a href="http://www.iovi.com/blog/2013/10/11/optimal-isolation-level/">Optimal JDBC Transaction Isolation Level</a> and <a href="http://www.iovi.com/blog/2013/10/21/optimistic-and-pessimistic-locking/">Optimistic and Pessimistic Locking</a></p>

<h3>Optimization with Statement</h3>

<p>Statement interface represents SQL query and execution and they provide number of methods and constants to work with queries. They also provide some methods to fine tune performance. Programmer may overlook these fine tuning methods that result in poor performance. The following are the tips to improve performance by using statement interfaces</p>

<ol>
<li>Choose the right Statement interface</li>
<li>Do batch update</li>
<li>Do batch retrieval using Statement</li>
<li>Close Statement when finished</li>
</ol>


<h4>1. Choose right Statement interface</h4>

<p>There are three types of Statement interfaces in JDBC to represent the SQL query and execute that query, they are Statement, PreparedStatement and CallableStatement.
Statement is used for static SQL statement with no input and output parameters, PreparedStatement is used for dynamic SQL statement with input parameters and CallableStatement is used for dynamic SQL satement with both input and output parameters, but PreparedStatement and CallableStatement can be used for static SQL statements as well. CallableStatement is mainly meant for stored procedures.</p>

<p>PreparedStatement gives better performance when compared to Statement because it is pre-parsed and pre-compiled by the database once for the first time and then onwards it reuses the parsed and compiled statement. Because of this feature, it significantly improves performance when a statement executes repeatedly, It reduces the overload incurred by parsing and compiling.</p>

<p>CallableStatement gives better performance when compared to PreparedStatement and Statement when there is a requirement for single request to process multiple complex statements. It parses and stores the stored procedures in the database and does all the work at database itself that in turn improves performance. But we loose java portability and we have to depend up on database specific stored procedures.</p>

<h4>2. Do batch update</h4>

<p>You can send multiple queries to the database at a time using batch update feature of statement objects this reduces the number of JDBC calls and improves performance. Here is an example of how you can do batch update,</p>

<pre><code>statement.addBatch( "sql query1");
statement.addBatch(" sql query2");
statement.addBatch(" sql query3");
statement.executeBatch();
</code></pre>

<p><strong>All</strong> three types of statements have these methods to do batch update.</p>

<h4>3. Do batch retrieval using Statement</h4>

<p>You can get the default number of rows that is provided by the driver. You can improve performance by increasing number of rows to be fetched at a time from database using <code>setFetchSize()</code> method of the statement object.Initially find the default size by using <code>Statement.getFetchSize();</code>   and then set the size as per your requirement <code>Statement.setFetchSize(30);</code>Here it retrieves 30 rows at a time for all result sets of this statement.</p>

<h4>4. Close Statement when finished</h4>

<p>Close statement object as soon as you finish working with that, it explicitly gives a chance to garbage collector to recollect memory as early as possible which in turn effects performance. Statement.close();</p>

<h3>Optimization with ResultSet</h3>

<p>ResultSet interface represents data that contains the results of executing an SQL Query and it provides a number of methods and constants to work with that data. It also provides methods to fine tune retrieval of data to improve performance. The following are the fine tuning tips to improve performance by using ResultSet interface.
1. Do batch retrieval using ResultSet
2. Set up proper direction for processing the rows
3. Use proper get methods
4. Close ResultSet when finished</p>

<h4>1. Do batch retrieval using ResultSet</h4>

<p>ResultSet interface also provides batch retrieval facility like Statement as mentioned above. It overrides the Statement behaviour. Initially find the default size by using
<code>ResultSet.getFetchSize();</code> and then set the size as per requirement <code>ResultSet.setFetchSize(50);</code> This feature significantly improves performance when you are dealing with retrieval of large number of rows like search functionality.</p>

<h4>2. Setup proper direction of processing rows</h4>

<p>ResultSet has the capability of setting the direction in which you want to process the results, it has three constants for this purpose, they are <code>FETCH_FORWARD</code>, <code>FETCH_REVERSE</code>, <code>FETCH_UNKNOWN</code>. Initially find the direction by using <code>ResultSet.getFetchDirection();</code> and then set the direction accordingly <code>ResultSet.setFetchDirection(FETCH_REVERSE);</code></p>

<h4>3. Use proper <code>getxxx()</code> methods</h4>

<p>ResultSet interface provides lot of getxxx() methods to get and convert database data types to java data types and is flexibile in converting non feasible data types. For example, <code>getString(String columnName)</code> returns java String object. <code>columnName</code> is recommended to be a <code>VARCHAR</code> or <code>CHAR</code> type of database but it can also be a <code>NUMERIC</code>, <code>DATE</code> etc.If you give non recommended parameters, it needs to cast it to proper java data type that is  expensive. For example consider that  you select  a product&rsquo;s id from huge database which returns millions of records from search functionality, it needs to convert all these records that is very expensive.
So always use proper getxxx() methods according to JDBC recommendations.</p>

<h4>4. Close ResultSet when finished</h4>

<p>Close ResultSet object as soon as you finish working with ResultSet object even though Statement object closes the ResultSet object implicitly when it closes, closing ResultSet explicitly gives chance to garbage collector to recollect memory as early as possible because ResultSet object may occupy lot of memory depending on query.
<code>ResultSet.close();</code></p>

<h3>Optimization with SQL Query</h3>

<p>This is one of the area where programmers generally make a mistake. If you give a query like</p>

<pre><code>Statement stmt = connection.createStatement();
ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery("select * from employee where name=RR");
</code></pre>

<p>The returned result set contains all the columns data. you may not need all the column data and want only salary for RR.
The better query is <code>"select salary from employee where name=RR"</code>
It returns the required data  and reduces unnecessary data retrieval. Make your query specific.</p>

<p>Another smart query ex: get employees in ENG dept
Instead of:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM employees;
SELECT * FROM dept;
</code></pre>

<p>(and joining on Java application side)
Use database join:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT employees.* FROM employees E, 
dept D WHERE E.DEPTNO = D.DEPTNO AND 
D.DEPTTYPE = 'ENG';
</code></pre>

<h3>Cache the read-only and read-mostly data</h3>

<p>Every database schema generally has read-only and read-mostly tables. These tables are called as lookup tables. Read-only tables contain static data that never changes in its life time. Read-mostly tables contain semi dynamic data that changes often. There will not be any sort of writing operations in these tables.
If an application reads data from these tables for every client request, then it is redundant, unnecessary and expensive. The solution for this problem is to cache the read-only table data by reading the data from that table once and caching the read-mostly table data by reading and refreshing with time limit. This solution improves performance significantly. See the following link for source code of such <a href="http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-07-2001/jw-0720-cache.html">caching mechanism</a>.</p>

<p>You can tweak this code as per application requirement. For read-only data, you need not refresh data in its life time. For read-mostly data, you need to refresh the data with time limit. It is better to set this refreshing time limit in properties file so that it can be changed at any time.</p>

<h4>Fetch small amount of data iteratively instead of fetching whole data at once</h4>

<p>Applications generally require to retrieve huge data from the database using JDBC in operations  like searching data. If the client request for a search, the application might return the whole result set at once. This process takes lot of time and has an impact on performance. The solution for the problem is</p>

<ol>
<li>Cache the search data at the server-side and return the data iteratively to the client. For example, the search returns 1000 records, return data to the client in 10 iterations where each iteration has 100 records.</li>
<li>Use Stored procedures to return data iteratively. This does not use server-side caching rather server-side application uses Stored procedures to return small amount of data iteratively.</li>
</ol>


<p>Out of these solutions the second solution gives better performance because it need not keep the data in the cache (in-memory). The first procedure is useful when the total amount of data to be returned is not huge.</p>

<h2>Key Points</h2>

<ul>
<li>Use Type two driver for two tiered applications to communicate from java client to database that gives better performance than Type1 driver.</li>
<li>Use Type four driver for applet to database communication that is two tiered applications and three tiered applications when compared to other drivers.</li>
<li>Use Type one driver if you don&rsquo;t have a driver for your database. This is a rare situation because all major databases support drivers or you will get a driver from third party vendors.</li>
<li>Use Type three driver to communicate between client and proxy server ( weblogic, websphere etc) for three tiered applications that gives better performance when compared to Type 1&amp;2 drivers.</li>
<li>Pass database specific properties like defaultPrefetch if your database supports any of them.</li>
<li>Get database connection from connection pool rather than getting it directly</li>
<li>Use batch transactions.</li>
<li>Choose right isolation level as per your requirement. TRANSACTION_READ_UNCOMMITED gives best performance for concurrent transaction based applications. TRANSACTION_NONE gives best performance for non-concurrent transaction based applications.
*Your database server may not support all isolation levels, be aware of your database server features.</li>
<li>Use PreparedStatement when you execute the same statement more than once.</li>
<li>Use CallableStatement when you want result from multiple and complex statements for a single request.</li>
<li>Use batch update facility available in Statements.</li>
<li>Use batch retrieval facility available in Statements or ResultSet.</li>
<li>Set up proper direction for processing rows.</li>
<li>Use proper getXXX() methods.</li>
<li>Close ResultSet, Statement and Connection whenever you finish your work with them.</li>
<li>Write precise SQL queries.</li>
<li>Cache read-only and read-mostly tables data.</li>
<li>Fetch small amount of data iteratively rather than whole data at once when retrieving large amount of data like searching database etc.</li>
</ul>

    <id>http://www.iovi.com/blog/2013/10/21/optimistic-and-pessimistic-locking</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Locking Introduction</h2>

<p>This article talks about serveral ways of doing locking. It starts with concurrency problems and then discusses about 2 ways of doing optimistic locking. As optimistic locking does not solve the concurrency issues from roots, it introduces pessimistic locking. It then moves ahead to explain how isolation levels can help us implement pessimistic locking. Each isolation level is explained with sample demonstration to make concepts clearer.</p>

<h2>Why do we need locking?</h2>

<p>In multi-user environment it&rsquo;s possible that multiple users can update the same record at the same time causing confusion between users. This issue is termed as concurrency.</p>

<h2>How can we solve concurrency problems?</h2>

<p>Concurrency problems can be solved by implementing proper &ldquo;Locking strategy&rdquo;. Locks prevent action on a resource to be performed when some other resource is already performing some action on it.</p>

<h2>Optimistic Locking</h2>

<p>As the name suggests &ldquo;optimistic&rdquo; it assumes that multiple transaction will work without affecting each other. In other words no locks are enforced while doing optimistic locking. The transaction just verifies that no other transaction has modified the data. In case of modification the transaction is rolled back.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h3>How does optimistic lock work?</h3>

<p>You can implement optimistic locking by numerous ways but the fundamental to implement optimistic locking remains same. It&rsquo;s a 4 step process as shown below:</p>

<ol>
<li>Record the current timestamp.</li>
<li>Start changing the values.</li>
<li>Before updating check whether anyone else has changed the values by checking the old time stamp and new time stamp or the old value and the current value in database.</li>
<li>If it&rsquo;s not equal rollbacks or else commit.</li>
</ol>


<p><img src="http://www.iovi.com/images/upload/optimistic_locking.jpg" alt="optimistic_locking" /></p>

<pre><code>update tbl_items set itemname='itemname' where CurrentTimestamp='OldTimeStamp'

update tbl_items set itemname=@itemname where itemname=@OldItemNameValue
</code></pre>

<h2>Pessimistic Locking</h2>

<p>But it looks like by using optimistic locking concurrency problems are not really solved?Yes, you said right. By using optimistic locking you only detect the concurrency problem. To solve concurrency issues from the roots itself we need to use pessimistic locking. Optimistic is like prevention while pessimistic locking is actually the cure.
Pessimistic locking assumes that concurrency/collision issues will happen so a lock is placed on the records and then data is updated.</p>

<h3>How can we do pessimistic locking?</h3>

<p>We can do pessimistic locking by specifying &ldquo;IsolationLevel&rdquo; in SQL Server stored procedures, ADO.NET level or by using transaction scope object, in java the JDBC Connection.</p>

<h3>What kind of locks can be acquired by using pessimistic locking?</h3>

<p>There are 4 kinds of locks you can acquire Shared, Exclusive, Update and intent. The first two are actual locks while the other two are hybrid locks and marker. Correspondingly, in SQL there are 4 kinds of transaction isolation level, below is a simple table which shows when to use them and what locks they put.</p>

<table>

<th align="center">Isolation Level      </th>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Choose optimal isolation level</h2>

<p>Isolation level represent how a database maintains data integrity against the problems like dirty reads, phantom reads and non-repeatable reads which can occur due to concurrent transactions. java.sql.Connection interface provides  methods and constants to avoid the above mentioned problems by setting different isolation levels.</p>

<pre><code>public interface Connection {
    public static final int  TRANSACTION_NONE                 = 0
    public static final int  TRANSACTION_READ_COMMITTED       = 2
    public static final int  TRANSACTION_READ_UNCOMMITTED     = 1
    public static final int  TRANSACTION_REPEATABLE_READ      = 4
    public static final int  TRANSACTION_SERIALIZABLE         = 8
    int    getTransactionIsolation();
    void   setTransactionIsolation(int isolationlevelconstant);
}
</code></pre>

<p>You can get the existing isolation level with getTransactionIsolation() method and set the isolation level with setTransactionIsolation(int isolationlevelconstant) by passing above constants to this method.
The following table describes isolation level against the problem that it prevents :</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th align="center">Transaction Level       </th>
<th align="center"> Dirty reads   </th>
<th align="center">Non  Repeatable reads  </th>

</tbody>
</table>


<br/>


<ul>
<li>YES means that the Isolation level does not prevent the problem</li>
<li>NO means that the Isolation level prevents the problem</li>
</ul>


<p>By setting isolation levels, you are having an impact on the performance as mentioned in the above table. Database use read and write locks to control above isolation levels. Let us have a look at each of these problems and then look at the impact on the performance.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h3>Dirty read problem :</h3>

<p>The following figure illustrates Dirty read problem  :</p>

<p> <img src="http://www.iovi.com/images/upload/dirty_read.gif" alt="dirty_read" /></p>

<pre><code>Step 1:    Database row has PRODUCT = A001 and PRICE = 10
Step 2:    Connection1 starts  Transaction1 (T1) .
Step 3:    Connection2 starts  Transaction2 (T2) .
Step 4:    T1 updates PRICE =20 for PRODUCT = A001
Step 5:    Database has now PRICE = 20 for PRODUCT = A001
Step 6:    T2 reads PRICE = 20 for PRODUCT = A001
Step 7:    T2 commits transaction
Step 8:    T1 rollbacks the transaction because of some problem
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that T2 gets wrong PRICE=20 for PRODUCT = A001 instead of 10 because of uncommitted read.Obviously it is very dangerous in critical transactions if you read inconsistent data. If you  are sure about not accessing data concurrently  then you can allow this problem by setting TRANSACTION_READ_UNCOMMITED or TRANSACTION_NONE that in turn improves performance otherwise you have to use TRANSACTION_READ_COMMITED to avoid this problem.</p>

<h3>Unrepeatable read problem :</h3>

<p>The following figure illustrates Unrepeatable read problem  :</p>

<p><img src="http://www.iovi.com/images/upload/unrepeatable_read.gif" alt="unrepeatable_read" /></p>

<pre><code>Step 1:    Database row has PRODUCT = A001 and PRICE = 10
Step 2:    Connection1 starts  Transaction1 (T1) .
Step 3:    Connection2 starts  Transaction2 (T2) .
Step 4:    T1 reads PRICE =10 for PRODUCT = A001
Step 5:    T2 updates PRICE = 20 for PRODUCT = A001
Step 6:    T2 commits transaction
Step 7:    Database row has PRODUCT = A001 and PRICE = 20
Step 8:    T1 reads PRICE = 20 for PRODUCT = A001
Step 9:    T1 commits transaction
</code></pre>

<p>Here the problem is that Transaction1 reads 10 first time and reads 20 second time but it is supposed to be 10 always whenever it reads a record in that transaction. You can control this problem by setting isolation level as TRANSACTION_REPEATABLE_READ(setting for which one? Of course both).</p>

<h3>Phantom read problem :</h3>

<p>The following figure illustrates Phantom read problem  :</p>

<p><img src="http://www.iovi.com/images/upload/phantom_read.gif" alt="phantom_read" /></p>

<pre><code>Step 1:    Database has a row PRODUCT = A001 and COMPANY_ID = 10
Step 2:    Connection1 starts  Transaction1 (T1) .
Step 3:    Connection2 starts  Transaction2 (T2) .
Step 4:    T1 selects a row with a condition SELECT PRODUCT WHERE COMPANY_ID = 10
Step 5:    T2 inserts a row with a condition INSERT PRODUCT=A002  WHERE COMPANY_ID= 10
Step 6:    T2 commits transaction
Step 7:    Database has 2 rows with that condition
Step 8:    T1 select again with a condition SELECT PRODUCT WHERE COMPANY_ID=10 and gets 2 rows instead of 1 row
Step 9:    T1 commits transaction
</code></pre>

<p>Here the problem is that T1 gets 2 rows instead of 1 row up on selecting the same condition second time. You can control this problem by setting isolation level as <code>TRANSACTION_SERIALIZABLE</code></p>

<h2>Choosing a right isolation level for your program:</h2>

<p>Choosing a right isolation level for your program depends upon your application&rsquo;s requirement. In single application itself the requirement generally changes, suppose if you write a program for searching a product catalog from your database then you can easily choose <code>TRANSACTION_READ_UNCOMMITED</code> because you need not worry about the problems that are mentioned above, some other program can insert records at the same time, you don&rsquo;t have to bother much about that insertion. Obviously this improves performance significantly.</p>

<p>If you write a critical program like bank or stocks analysis program where you want to control all of the above mentioned problems, you can choose TRANSACTION_SERIALIZABLE for maximum safety. Here it is the tradeoff between the safety and performance. Ultimately we need safety here.
If you don&rsquo;t have to deal with concurrent transactions your application, then the best choice is <code>TRANSACTION_NONE</code> to improve performance.
Other two isolation levels need good understanding of your requirement. If your application needs only committed records, then <code>TRANSACTION_READ_COMMITED</code> isolation is the good choice. If your application needs to read a row exclusively till you  finish your work, then <code>TRANSACTION_REPEATABLE_READ</code> is the best choice.
Note: Be aware of your database server&rsquo;s support for these isolation levels. Database servers may not support all of these isolation levels. Oracle server supports only two isolation levels, <code>TRANSACTION_READ_COMMITED</code> and <code>TRANSACTION_SERIALIZABLE</code> isolation level, default isolation level is <code>TRANSACTION_READ_COMMITED</code>.</p>

</ul>


<h2>Conventions used here:</h2>

<ul>
<li>MySQL keywords are shown in CAPS</li>
<li>User-specified names are in small letters</li>
<li>Optional items are enclosed in square brackets [ ]</li>
<li>Items in parentheses must appear in the command, along with the parentheses</li>
<li>Items that can be repeated as often as desired are indicated by an ellipsis &hellip;</li>
</ul>


<h2>Quoting in MySQL Statements</h2>

<ul>
<li>Don&rsquo;t quote database, table, or column names</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t quote column types or modifiers</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t quote numerical values</li>
<li>Quote (single or double) non-numeric values</li>
<li>Quote file names and passwords</li>
<li>Usernames are NOT quoted in GRANT or REVOKE statements, but they are quoted in other statements.</li>
</ul>


<h2>General Commands</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><code>USE database_name</code><br/>
Change to specific database. You need to change to some database when you first connect to MySQL.</p></li>
<li><p><code>SHOW DATABASES</code><br/>
Lists all MySQL databases on the system.</p></li>
<li><p><code>SHOW TABLES [FROM database_name]</code><br/>
Lists all tables from the current database or from the database given in the command.</p></li>
</ul>


<!-- more -->


<ul>
<li><p><code>DESCRIBE table_name</code>;<code>SHOW FIELDS FROM table_name</code>;<code>SHOW COLUMNS FROM table_name</code>
These commands all give a list of all columns (fields) from the given table, along with column type and other info.</p></li>
<li><p><code>SHOW INDEX FROM table_name</code>
Lists all indexes from this tables.</p></li>
<li><p><code>SET PASSWORD=PASSWORD('new_password')</code><br/>
Allows the user to set his/her own password.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Table Commands</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><code>CREATE TABLE table_name (create_clause1, create_clause2, ...)</code></p>

<ul>
<li>Creates a table with columns as indicated in the create clauses.</li>
<li>create_clause: column name followed by column type, followed optionally by modifiers. For example, &ldquo;gene_id INT      AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY&rdquo; (without the quotes) creates a column of type integer with the modifiers described below.</li>
<li>create_clause modifiers

<ul>
<li>AUTO_INCREMENT : each data record is assigned the next sequential number when it is given a NULL value.</li>
<li>PRIMARY KEY : Items in this column have unique names, and the table is indexed automatically based on this column. One column must be the PRIMARY KEY, and only one column may be the PRIMARY KEY. This column should also be NOT NULL.</li>
<li>NOT NULL : No NULL values are allowed in this column: a NULL generates an error message as the data is inserted into the table.</li>
<li>DEFAULT value : If a NULL value is used in the data for this column, the default value is entered instead.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><code>DROP TABLE table_name</code><br/>
Removes the table from the database. Permanently! So be careful with this command!</p></li>
<li><p><code>ALTER TABLE table_name ADD (create_clause1, create_clause2, ...)</code><br/>
Adds the listed columns to the table.</p></li>
<li><p><code>ALTER TABLE table_name DROP column_name</code><br/>
Drops the listed columns from the table.</p></li>
<li><p><code>ALTER TABLE table_name MODIFY create_clause</code><br/>
Changes the type or modifiers to a column. Using MODIFY means that the column keeps the same name even though its type is altered. MySQL attempts to convert the data to match the new type: this can cause problems.</p></li>
<li><p><code>ALTER TABLE table_name CHANGE column_name create_clause</code>  <br/>
Changes the name and type or modifiers of a column. Using CHANGE (instead of MODIFY) implies that the column is getting a new name.</p></li>
<li><p><code>ALTER TABLE table_name ADD INDEX [index_name] (column_name1, column_name2, ...)</code> or
<code>CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name (column_name1, column_name2, ...)</code>  <br/>
Adds an index to this table, based on the listed columns. Note that the order of the columns is important, because additional indexes are created from all subsets of the listed columns reading from left to write. The index name is optional if you use ALTER TABLE, but it is necesary if you use CREATE INDEX. Rarely is the name of an index useful (in my experience).</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Data Commands</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><code>INSERT [INTO] table_name VALUES (value1, value2, ...)</code><br/>
Insert a complete row of data, giving a value (or NULL) for every column in the proper order.</p></li>
<li><p><code>INSERT [INTO] table_name (column_name1, column_name2, ...) VALUES (value1, value2, ...)</code> or
<code>INSERT [INTO] table_name SET column_name1=value1, column_name2=value2, ...</code><br/>
Insert data into the listed columns only. Alternate forms, with the SET form showing column assignments more explicitly.</p></li>
<li><p><code>INSERT [INTO] table_name (column_name1, column_name2, ...) SELECT list_of_fields_from_another_table FROM other_table_name WHERE where_clause</code><br/>
Inserts the data resulting from a SELECT statement into the listed columns. Be sure the number of items taken from the old table match the number of columns they are put into!</p></li>
<li><p><code>DELETE FROM table_name WHERE where_clause</code><br/>
Delete rows that meet the conditions of the where_clause. If the WHERE statement is omitted, the table is emptied, although its structure remains intact.</p></li>
<li><p><code>UPDATE table_name SET column_name1=value1, column_name2=value2, ... [WHERE where_clause]</code><br/>
Alters the data within a column based on the conditions in the where_clause.</p></li>
<li><p><code>LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE 'path to external file' INTO TABLE table_name</code><br/>
Loads data from the listed file into the table. The default assumption is that fields in the file are separated by tabs, and each data record is separated from the others by a newline. It also assumes that nothing is quoted: quote marks are considered to be part of the data. Also, it assumes that the number of data fields matches the number of table columns. Columns that are AUTO_INCREMENT should have NULL as their value in the file.</p></li>
<li><p><code>LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE 'path to external file' [FIELDS TERMINATED BY 'termination_character'] [FIELDS ENCLOSED BY 'quoting character'] [LINES TERMINATED BY 'line termination character'] FROM table_name</code><br/>
Loads data from the listed file into the table, using the field termination character listed (default is tab \t), and/or the listed quoting character (default is nothing), and/or the listed line termination chacracter (default is a newline \n).</p></li>
<li><p><code>SELECT column_name1, column_name2, ... INTO OUTFILE 'path to external file' [FIELDS TERMINATED BY 'termination_character'] [FIELDS ENCLOSED BY 'quoting character'] [LINES TERMINATED BY 'line termination character'] FROM table_name [WHERE where_clause]</code><br/>
Allows you to move data from a table into an external file. The field and line termination clauses are the same as for LOAD above. Several tricky features:</p>

<ol>
<li> Note the positions of the table_name and where_clause, after the external file is given.</li>
<li> You must use a complete path, not just a file name. Otherwise MySQL attempts to write to the directory where the database is stored, where you don&rsquo;t have permission to write.</li>
<li> The user who is writing the file is &lsquo;mysql&rsquo;, not you! This means that user &lsquo;mysql&rsquo; needs permission to write to the directory you specify. The best way to do that is to creat a new directory under your home directory, then change the directory&rsquo;s permission to 777, then write to it. For example: mkdir mysql_output, chmod 777 mysql_output.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>


<h2>Privilege Commands</h2>

<p>Most of the commands below require MySQL root access</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO user_name@localhost [IDENTIFIED BY 'password']</code><br/>
Creates a new user on MySQL, with no rights to do anything. The IDENTIFED BY clause creates or changes the MySQL password, which is not necessarily the same as the user&rsquo;s system password. The @localhost after the user name allows usage on the local system, which is usually what we do; leaving this off allows the user to access the database from another system. User name NOT in quotes.</p></li>
<li><p><code>GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO user_name@localhost</code><br/>
In general, unless data is supposed to be kept private, all users should be able to view it. A debatable point, and most databases will only grant SELECT privileges on particular databases. There is no way to grant privileges on all databses EXCEPT specifically enumerated ones.</p></li>
<li><p><code>GRANT ALL ON database_name.* TO user_name@localhost</code><br/>
Grants permissions on all tables for a specific database (database_name.*) to a user. Permissions are for: ALTER, CREATE, DELETE, DROP, INDEX, INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE.</p></li>
<li><p><code>FLUSH PRIVILEGES</code><br/>
Needed to get updated privileges to work immediately. You need RELOAD privileges to get this to work.</p></li>
<li><p><code>SET PASSWORD=PASSWORD('new_password')</code><br/>
Allows the user to set his/her own password.</p></li>
<li><p><code>REVOKE ALL ON [database_name.]* FROM user_name@localhost</code><br/>
Revokes all permissions for the user, but leaves the user in the MySQL database. This can be done for all databases using &ldquo;ON *&rdquo;, or for all tables within a specific databse, using &ldquo;ON database_name.*&rdquo;.</p></li>
<li><p><code>DELETE FROM mysql.user WHERE user='user_name@localhost'</code><br/>
Removes the user from the database, which revokes all privileges. Note that the user name is in quotes here.</p></li>
<li><p><code>UPDATE mysql.user SET password=PASSWORD('my_password') WHERE user='user_name'</code><br/>
Sets the user&rsquo;s password. The PASSWORD function encrypts it; otherwise it will be in plain text.</p></li>
<li><p><code>SELECT user, host, password, select_priv, insert_priv, shutdown_priv, grant_priv FROM mysql.user</code><br/>
A good view of all users and their approximate privileges. If there is a password, it will by an encrytped string; if not, this field is blank. Select is a very general privlege; insert allows table manipulation within a database; shutdown allows major system changes, and should only be usable by root; the ability to grant permissions is separate from the others.</p></li>
<li><p><code>SELECT user, host, db, select_priv, insert_priv, grant_priv FROM mysql.db</code><br/>
View permissions for individual databases.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Backup Tool</h2>

<h3>Back up From the Command Line (using mysqldump)</h3>

<p>If you have shell or telnet access to your web server, you can backup your MySQL data by using the mysqldump command. This command connects to the MySQL server and creates an SQL dump file. The dump file contains the SQL statements necessary to re-create the database. Here is the proper syntax:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>mysqldump --opt -u [uname] -p[pass] [dbname] &gt; [backupfile.sql]</code><br/>
This command will backup the &lsquo;Tutorials&rsquo; database into a file called tut_backup.sql which will contain all the SQL statements needed to re-create the database.</p></li>
<li><p><code>mysqldump -u root -p Tutorials php_tutorials asp_tutorials &gt; tut_backup.sql</code><br/>
With mysqldump command you can specify certain tables of your database you want to backup. For example, to back up only php_tutorials and asp_tutorials tables from the &lsquo;Tutorials&rsquo; database accomplish the command below. Each table name has to be separated by space.</p></li>
<li><p><code>mysqldump -u root -p --databases Tutorials Articles Comments &gt; content_backup.sql</code><br/>
Sometimes it is necessary to back up more that one database at once. In this case you can use the &mdash;database option followed by the list of databases you would like to backup. Each database name has to be separated by space.</p></li>
<li><p><code>mysqldump -u root -p --all-databases &gt; alldb_backup.sql</code><br/>
If you want to back up all the databases in the server at one time you should use the &mdash;all-databases option. It tells MySQL to dump all the databases it has in storage.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>The mysqldump command has also some other useful options:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><code>--add-drop-table</code>: Tells MySQL to add a D<code>ROP TABLE</code> statement before each <code>CREATE TABLE</code> in the dump.</p></li>
<li><p><code>--no-data</code>: Dumps only the database structure, not the contents.</p></li>
<li><p><code>--add-locks</code>: Adds the <code>LOCK TABLES</code> and <code>UNLOCK TABLES</code> statements you can see in the dump file.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>The mysqldump command has advantages and disadvantages. The advantages of using mysqldump are that it is simple to use and it takes care of table locking issues for you. The disadvantage is that the command locks tables. If the size of your tables is very big mysqldump can lock out users for a long period of time.</p>

<h3>Back up your MySQL Database with Compress</h3>

<ul>
<li><p><code>mysqldump -u [uname] -p[pass] [dbname] | gzip -9 &gt; [backupfile.sql.gz]</code>
If your mysql database is very big, you might want to compress the output of mysqldump. Just use the mysql backup command below and pipe the output to gzip, then you will get the output as gzip file.</p></li>
<li><p><code>gunzip [backupfile.sql.gz]</code><br/>
If you want to extract the .gz file, use the command above:</p></li>
<li><p><code>Restoring your MySQL Database</code><br/>
Above we backup the Tutorials database into tut_backup.sql file. To re-create the Tutorials database you should follow two steps:</p>

<ol>
<li> Create an appropriately named database on the target machine</li>
<li> Load the file using the mysql command:</li>
<li> $ mysql -u [uname] -p[pass] [db_to_restore] &lt; [backupfile.sql]</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>


<p>Have a look how you can restore your tut_backup.sql file to the Tutorials database.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>To restore compressed backup files you can do the following:<br/>
gunzip &lt; [backupfile.sql.gz] | mysql -u [uname] -p[pass] [dbname]</p></li>
<li><p>If you need to restore a database that already exists, you&rsquo;ll need to use mysqlimport command. The syntax for mysqlimport is as follows:<br/>
mysqlimport -u [uname] -p[pass] [dbname] [backupfile.sql]</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Operations over Web with PHPMyAdmin</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>It is assumed that you have phpMyAdmin installed since a lot of web service providers use it. To backup your MySQL database using PHPMyAdmin just follow a couple of steps:</p>

<ol>
<li> Open phpMyAdmin.</li>
<li> Select your database by clicking the database name in the list on the left of the screen.</li>
<li> Click the Export link. This should bring up a new screen that says View dump of database (or something similar).</li>
<li> In the Export area, click the Select All link to choose all of the tables in your database.</li>
<li> In the SQL options area, click the right options.</li>
<li> Click on the Save as file option and the corresponding compression option and then click the &lsquo;Go&rsquo; button. A dialog box should appear prompting you to save the file locally.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Restoring your database is easy as well as backing it up. Make the following:</p>

<ol>
<li> Open phpMyAdmin.</li>
<li> Create an appropriately named database and select it by clicking the database name in the list on the left of the screen. If you would like to rewrite the backup over an    1. existing database then click on the database name, select all the check boxes next to the table names and select Drop to delete all existing tables in the database.</li>
<li> Click the SQL link. This should bring up a new screen where you can either type in SQL commands, or upload your SQL file.</li>
<li> Use the browse button to find the database file.</li>
<li> Click Go button. This will upload the backup, execute the SQL commands and re-create your database.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
